# 2b2t IRC
![2b2t IRC Icon](src/main/resources/assets/irc2b2t/icon.png)
## Description
2b2t IRC is a mod for the popular Minecraft server 2b2t, designed to provide an alternative chat system to replace the in-game chat. This mod aims to address the issue of players being randomly muted in 2b2t's chat without being provided with a reason for their mute. With 2b2t IRC, players can enjoy an uncensored chat experience, as long as they refrain from engaging in any illegal activities.

## Installation
1. Download and install the latest version of Minecraft Fabric.
2. Download the 2b2t IRC mod from the releases section of this GitHub repository, Modrinth, or CurseForge.
3. Place the downloaded mod file into the "mods" folder in your Minecraft installation directory.
4. Launch Minecraft and enjoy the new uncensored chat experience on 2b2t!

## Usage
Once the mod is installed, simply join the 2b2t server as you normally would and type `/irc` to toggle sending messages to IRC. Chat freely and express yourself without the fear of unexpected mutes, as long as you refrain from engaging in any illegal activities.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and features of 2b2t IRC. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute code, please open an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository.
